title: Diabetic retinopathy detection contest: what we did wrong
---

After watching the [awesome video course by Hugo Larochelle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH) on neural nets (more on this in the [previous post]({% post_url 2015-07-30-getting-started-with-neural-networks %})) we decided to test our knowledge on some computer vision contest. We looked at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and the only active competition related to computer vision (except for the [digit recognizer contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), for which lots of perfect out-of-the-box solutions exist) was the [Diabetic retinopathy detection contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection). This was probably quite hard to become our very first project, but nevertheless we decided to try. The team included [Karen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahnerak), [Tigran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/galstyantik), [Hrayr](https://github.com/Harhro94), [Narek](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/narek-hovsepyan/86/b35/380) and [me](https://github.com/Hrant-Khachatrian). Long story short, we finished at the [82nd place](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/leaderboard), and in this post I will describe in details what we did and what mistakes we made. We hope this will be interesting for those who just start to play with neural networks. Also we hope to get feedback from experts and other participants.


## The contest
[Diabetic retinopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy) is a disease when the retina of the eye is damaged due to diabetes. It is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. The contest's aim was to see if computer programs can diagnose the disease automatically from the image of the retina. [It seems](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/forums/t/15605/human-performance-on-the-competition-data-set) the winners slightly surpassed the performance of general ophthalmologists. 

Each eye of the patient can be in one of the 5 levels, from 0 to 4, where 0 corresponds to the healthy state and 4 is the most severe state. Different eyes of the same person can be at different levels (also some contestants managed to leverage the fact that two eyes are not completely independent). Contestants [were given](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data) 35126 JPEG images of retinas for training (32.5GB), 53576 images for testing (49.6GB) and a CSV file where level of the disease is written for the train images. The goal was to create a CSV file where disease levels are written for each of the test images. Contestants could submit maximum 5 CSV files per day. 

The score is evaluated using a metric called *quadratic weighted kappa*. It is [described](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/details/evaluation) as being an _agreement_ between two raters, in this case: the agreement between the scores assigned by human rater (which is unknown to contestants) and the predicted scores. It is _quadratic_ in a sense that, for example, if you predict level 4 for a healthy eye, it is 16 times worse than if you predict level 1. 

## Software and hardware
It was obvious that we were going to use [convolutional neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxKrCa4bg1I&index=69&list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH) for predicting. Not only because of its [awesome performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#Applications) on many computer vision problems, including another Kaggle competition on [plankton classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl), but also because it was the only technique we knew for image classification. We knew several libraries that implement convolutional networks, namely Python-based [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) written in C++, [cxxnet](https://github.com/dmlc/cxxnet) (developed by the [2nd  place winners](https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl/forums/t/12887/brief-describe-method-and-cxxnet-v2/69545) of the plankton contest). We chose Caffe because it seemed to be the simplest one for beginners.

We didn't have a computer with CUDA-enabled GPU in the university, but our friends at [Cyclop studio](http://cyclopstudio.com/) donated us an Intel Core i5 computer with 4GB RAM and [NVidia GeForce GTX 550 TI](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-550ti/specifications) card. 550 TI has a 1GB of memory which forced us to use very small batch sizes for the neural network. Later we switched to [GeForce GTX 980](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-980/specifications) with 4GB memory, which was completely fine for us.
