The success of neural word embedding models like [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) and [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) motivated research on representing sentences in an n-dimensional space. [Michael Manukyan](https://github.com/mike1808) and [Hrayr Harutyunyan](https://github.com/Harhro94) reviewed several sentence representation algorithms and their applications in state-of-the-art [automated question answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07905) systems during a talk at the Armenian NLP meetup. The slides of the talk are below. Follow us on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/YerevaNN/) to get the latest slides from YerevaNN.
